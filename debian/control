Package: thrift-compiler
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Compiler for Thrift definition files
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 Thrift came out of Facebook and is now an Apache Software Foundation project.
 .
 This package contains the Thrift compiler that is used for translating from
 .thrift files (containing the definitions) to the language binding for the
 supported languages.

 This package contains the Python bindings for Thrift. You will need the thrift
 tool (in the thrift-compiler package) to compile your definition to Python
 classes, and then the modules in this package will allow you to use those
 classes in your programs.
